## Code of Conduct

This project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct][conduct].
By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Workflow

* Fork the project.
* Make your bug fix or feature addition.

Pull requests for bug fixes must be based on the current stable branch whereas pull requests for new features must be based on the `master` branch.

## Coding Guidelines

This project follows the coding standards proposed in [PSR-2][psr2]

You can use [PHP CS fixer][fixer] to (re)format your sourcecode for compliance with this project's coding guidelines:

Run the following command to install the fixer.

```bash
$ composer global require friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer
```

Run the following command if you modified either production or test code.
It will fix any coding standard issue automatically.

```bash
$ make fix
```

[Make][make] will run the fixer in both folders `src` and `tests`.

## Using phUML from a Git checkout

The following commands can be used to perform the initial checkout of DBAL fixtures:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ComPHPPuebla/dbal-fixtures.git

$ cd dbal-fixtures
```

Retrieve DBAL fixture's dependencies using [Composer][composer]:

```bash
$ composer install
```

## Running DBAL fixture's test suite

Currently the test suite runs against [SQLite][sqlite] and [MySQL][mysql] only.
Please make sure you have both of them installed.

There's a `phpunit.xml.dist` file customized for [Travis][travis].
You'll want to create a `phpunit.xml` file with your local MySQL username and password.

There is no special configuration for SQLite, it should run out of the box.

Use this command to run the test suite

```
$ make test
```
